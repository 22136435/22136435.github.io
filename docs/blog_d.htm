"Flipping the souls-like formula is genius. Watching the hero learn your moves and level up is terrifying. You're strong, but never secure. Every kill is a learning experience—for both of you."

"This is a phenomenal idea and implementation. The levels are beautiful and creepy, and the narrative slowly unfolds to inform you of who you are—and why you're trapped. It's as emotional as it is violent."

"It's hard. REALLY hard. But bossing is so fresh. At first, I felt it was gimmicky, but after the third hero variant, I was hooked. Can't wait for DLC! "

"This is exactly what I got out of a tactical RPG. Your relationship with your dragon really does have an impact-it changes how you fight and how the world reacts.". It's like Dragonheart and Fire Emblem merged."

"Visually stunning and brimming with Celtic mythos. The choice of story slams you, especially when one of your wyrms dies forever. Warned: this game won't take it easy on your heart—or your strategic mind."

"Full of potential, but there are some balance tweaks that need to happen. I loved the permadeath mechanic but lost my favorite wyrm to an idiotic RNG crit. Though, can't wait for the next patch!"

"Headphones, dark room, and nearly threw my controller. Not jump scares—terror. Every aspect, from whispers to lighting, makes you tense. Masterclass in psychological horror."

"It's like SOMA and Silent Hill had a kid fathered by Welsh specters.". The shifting time mechanic did take a while to get used to, but once I did, the game was even scarier."

"Some of the puzzles were a little too cryptic, but the atmosphere makes up for it. I've never been so nervous to walk through an empty forest. This game dug into my head."
